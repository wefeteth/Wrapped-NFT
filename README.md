# Wrapped-NFT

Wrapped the NFT for liquidity.

The concept :

Initialise Wrapped NFT contract â†’ { Swap : NFT <-> ERC20 }

It is a sketch version of 10 minutes work with chatGPT, if you are familiar with smart contract , with some adjustment and the contract is ready to use for production. Use at your own risk.

Feature to add:
- Project Royalties enforcement for conversion, adjustable by the contract initiator which would be the team
- Wrapped NFT contract Name when created
